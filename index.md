# Engineering Portfolio  

 
I’m Nathan Stephens, a Senior Aerospace Engineering student at Florida Institute of Technology with hands-on experience in dynamic systems modeling, simulation, controls, structural analysis, and product development. I specialize in solving complex engineering problems using a combination of analytical modeling, numerical simulation, and hardware-focused design. My work spans multiple domains, including aerospace, mechanical systems, and embedded software, allowing me to bridge the gap between simulation, design, and real-world implementation.

<br>

Core Technical Strengths:
- Dynamic Systems & Controls: modeling with quaternions, PID/Lyapunov control, system identification, actuator modeling
- Simulation & Analysis: CFD (ANSYS Fluent), FEA (ANSYS Mechanical), MATLAB/Simulink modeling, rapid prototyping workflows
- Mechanics & Design: structural analysis, materials selection, CAD (Creo, NX, Fusion 360), mechanism design
- Programming & Software: MATLAB, Simulink, C++; embedded systems; algorithm development
- Systems Engineering: requirements development, system architecture, multidisciplinary design reviews, trade studies

<br>
I enjoy tackling challenging technical problems, building practical solutions, and delivering designs that are functional, reliable, and backed by engineering analysis.


###  **Some of my Engineering Projects Include:**
- [A.S.T.R.A CubeSat Drag-Sail System](projects/astra.md)
- [Attitude Determination & Control Simulator](projects/adcs.md)
- [LEO SAR Anti-Piracy Mission](projects/sar.md)
- [Payload-Carrying RC Aircraft](projects/rc_aircraft.md)


<br>

### Additional Technical Experience

- **Simulation Visualization & Asset Development:**  
  Created and integrated custom aircraft liveries for Flight Simulator X and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 using Blender and GIMP.  
  Work included UV-mapped texture alignment, high-resolution texture painting, and simulator-specific asset integration and verification. [Flight Simulator Livery Design Project](projects/flight-sim-liveries.html)

- **Technical Tooling:**  
  Experience working across graphical and simulation pipelines alongside analytical engineering tools, bridging visual design with system-level simulation environments.
