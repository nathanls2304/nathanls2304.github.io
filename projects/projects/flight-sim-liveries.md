title: Flight Simulator Livery Design
---

## Overview
Designed and implemented custom aircraft liveries for Flight Simulator X and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.  
This work involved 3D model texture mapping, high-resolution texture creation, and the integration of simulator-specific assets.

## Tools & Technologies
- Blender (UV mapping, texture alignment)
- GIMP (texture painting, layers, masks)
- Microsoft Flight Simulator SDK
- Flight Simulator X
- Visual Studio (config files and asset integration)

## What I Did
- Created high-resolution liveries mapped to existing aircraft UV layouts
- Designed realistic and fictional airline branding
- Ensured correct texture alignment across complex curved surfaces
- Integrated liveries into simulator environments and verified in-engine appearance

## Examples


> Note: Liveries shown are fictional and created for non-commercial simulation use.
