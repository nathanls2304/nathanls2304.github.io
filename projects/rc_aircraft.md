# Payload-Carrying RC Aircraft Conceptual Design Project

This project focused on the **conceptual design and performance analysis** of a radio-controlled aircraft intended to carry a specified payload while meeting strict size, weight, and flight performance constraints.

Due to time and resource limitations, the project concluded at the design and analysis phase and did not progress to physical fabrication or flight testing.

<br>

### Design Requirements

- Payload mass requirement
- Hand-launch capability
- Stable, controllable flight characteristics
- Compliance with size and weight constraints
- Feasibility within typical RC propulsion limits

These requirements guided the aerodynamic layout, mass budgeting, and propulsion selection.

<br>


## My Role

I contributed to the conceptual design and stability analysis of the aircraft, with primary responsibilities including:

- Aerodynamic sizing and overall configuration development
- Support of static stability analysis (center-of-gravity and static margin)
- Dynamic stability analysis and flight mode evaluation
- Interpretation of stability results to inform configuration refinements

My work focused on ensuring that the proposed aircraft configuration exhibited acceptable stability characteristics within the defined design constraints.


### Aerodynamic and Performance Analysis

The aircraft configuration was developed using classical fixed-wing aircraft design methods, including:

- Airfoil selection for low Reynolds number operation
- Wing area sizing to meet stall speed and payload requirements
- Lift, drag, and power required estimates
- Thrust-to-weight analysis for hand-launch feasibility
- Static margin evaluation for longitudinal stability


<br>

## Design Outcomes and Feasibility

The final configuration satisfied all specified design constraints in simulation and analytical models. Performance estimates indicated adequate lift, controllability, and propulsion margins for payload-carrying flight.

While fabrication and flight testing were not completed, the design demonstrated technical feasibility and highlighted key sensitivities in mass distribution and wing loading.

All visualizations shown represent a conceptual design model developed for analysis and layout purposes; physical fabrication and flight testing were not performed.

## Lessons Learned

- Payload mass and placement strongly influence aircraft sizing and stability
- Early mass budgeting is critical to meeting performance requirements
- Low Reynolds number aerodynamics significantly impact design choices
- Conceptual design requires balancing competing constraints rather than optimizing a single parameter
